# EssentialsReloaded

this is a new version of essentials, because i genuinely hate, how bloated EssentialsX is. I just don't need /jail on my SMP, goddamnit.

# Build

Maven... Preferred IDE is IDEA. Just add a Maven task with "clean package" and maybe "install"... I have a deploy script that copies the file to my server too
